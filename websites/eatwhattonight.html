Stepping into the 5th month of the Work-From-Home regime has definitely benefited me much. To be honest, I am getting so used to this WFM thingy that I can&#8217;t imagine myself waking up at 6ish-am in the mornings anymore, beating the maddening CBD crowds and trains to head to work again. But then again, if this doesn&#8217;t happen anymore also implied that this virus thing is still on-going which is neither something good either. I seriously missed travelling and holiday-ing a lotsssss.</p><figure data-carousel-extra='{"blog_id":1,"permalink":"https:\/\/eatwhattonight.com\/2020\/08\/ginger-soya-chicken\/"}'  class="is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-3 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img data-attachment-id="19625" data-permalink="https://eatwhattonight.com/2020/08/ginger-soya-chicken/dsc_0324-4/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0324-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2560,1707" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.4&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D5600&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1595089290&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;500&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.008&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="DSC_0324" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0324-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0324-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&amp;ssl=1" decoding="async" width="800" height="533" src="https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0324-scaled.jpg?resize=800%2C533&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-id="19625" data-full-url="https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0324-scaled.jpg?resize=800%2C533&#038;ssl=1" data-link="https://eatwhattonight.com/?attachment_id=19625" class="wp-image-19625" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0324-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0324-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0324-scaled.jpg?resize=83%2C55&amp;ssl=1 83w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0324-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0324-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0324-scaled.jpg?resize=750%2C500&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0324-scaled.jpg?resize=380%2C253&amp;ssl=1 380w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0324-scaled.jpg?resize=760%2C507&amp;ssl=1 760w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0324-scaled.jpg?resize=800%2C533&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0324-scaled.jpg?resize=900%2C600&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0324-scaled.jpg?resize=1800%2C1200&amp;ssl=1 1800w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0324-scaled.jpg?resize=1320%2C880&amp;ssl=1 1320w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0324-scaled.jpg?w=1600 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0324-scaled.jpg?w=2400 2400w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt="" data-jpibfi-post-url="https://eatwhattonight.com/2020/08/ginger-soya-chicken/" data-jpibfi-post-title="Ginger Soya Chicken" data-jpibfi-src="https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0324-scaled.jpg?resize=800%2C533&#038;ssl=1"  data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></li></ul></figure><p class="has-text-align-justify">But much has also been gained so far. I get to prepare more home-cooked meals, de-clutter more and also more time in tidying up the house. Before this, everything was always a mad rush over the short 2-days weekends with little rest time in between. And because I get to cook more often too, I managed this Ginger Soya Chicken earlier which is a little mock up of one of the dishes from one of my favourite Mixed Vegetables rice 杂菜饭 stall in my hood.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="19627" data-permalink="https://eatwhattonight.com/2020/08/ginger-soya-chicken/dsc_0329-4/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0329-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2560,1707" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.4&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D5600&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1595089335&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;500&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.008&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="DSC_0329" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0329-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0329-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&amp;ssl=1" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="533" src="https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0329-scaled.jpg?resize=800%2C533" alt="" class="wp-image-19627" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0329-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0329-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0329-scaled.jpg?resize=83%2C55&amp;ssl=1 83w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0329-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0329-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0329-scaled.jpg?resize=750%2C500&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0329-scaled.jpg?resize=380%2C253&amp;ssl=1 380w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0329-scaled.jpg?resize=760%2C507&amp;ssl=1 760w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0329-scaled.jpg?resize=800%2C533&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0329-scaled.jpg?resize=900%2C600&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0329-scaled.jpg?resize=1800%2C1200&amp;ssl=1 1800w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0329-scaled.jpg?resize=1320%2C880&amp;ssl=1 1320w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0329-scaled.jpg?w=1600 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0329-scaled.jpg?w=2400 2400w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt="" data-jpibfi-post-url="https://eatwhattonight.com/2020/08/ginger-soya-chicken/" data-jpibfi-post-title="Ginger Soya Chicken" data-jpibfi-src="https://i0.wp.com/eatwhattonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC_0329-scaled.jpg?resize=800%2C533"  data-recalc-dims="1"></figure><p class="has-text-align-justify">Though a pretty simple and homely Chinese fare, the gravy was indeed awesome with rice.

60g cashew nuts, chopped into halves (optional)  Caramel Sauce :
70g sugar
25g dark brown sugar
10g butter
2 tbsp water  Method :
1️⃣ Place corn kennels into a 24-cm deep wok pan, preferably with a transparent cover that comes with a steam outlet. Add in melted butter and mix well to coat with the corn kennels.  2️⃣ Cover the pan with medium heat. The corn kennels will start popping after a while. Once the popping stops completely, off the heat.  3️⃣ Combine all the ingredients for the caramel sauce and cook till the sugar melted. Add in the cashew nuts and continue cooking till the sugar caramelised.  4️⃣ You may adjust the sweetness of the pop corn by adjusting the amount of caramel sauce that is to be mixed with the pop corn. I used approx 4-5 tbsp of caramel sauce for every 60g of pop corn.  5️⃣ Stir the sauce evenly over the pop corn. I did this in small batches so that it’s easier to adjust the sweetness for different people. The caramel sauce will thicken once cooled down so be prepared to reheat the sauce when doing the next batch.  6️⃣ Spread the caramel pop corn onto a wired tray with  a baking tray beneath.

75g pop corn kennels
40g butter, melted
60g cashew nuts, chopped into halves (optional)  Caramel Sauce :
70g sugar
25g dark brown sugar
10g butter
2 tbsp water  Method :
1️⃣ Place corn kennels into a 24-cm deep wok pan, preferably with a transparent cover that comes with a steam outlet. Add in melted butter and mix well to coat with the corn kennels.  2️⃣ Cover the pan with medium heat. The corn kennels will start popping after a while. Once the popping stops completely, off the heat.  3️⃣ Combine all the ingredients for the caramel sauce and cook till the sugar melted. Add in the cashew nuts and continue cooking till the sugar caramelised.  4️⃣ You may adjust the sweetness of the pop corn by adjusting the amount of caramel sauce that is to be mixed with the pop corn. I used approx 4-5 tbsp of caramel sauce for every 60g of pop corn.  5️⃣ Stir the sauce evenly over the pop corn. I did this in small batches so that it’s easier to adjust the sweetness for different people. The caramel sauce will thicken once cooled down so be prepared to reheat the sauce when doing the next batch.  6️⃣ Spread the caramel pop corn onto a wired tray with  a baking tray beneath. Toast it at 180 degrees C for 4-5 mins in the middle rack before removing from heat. Allow to cool completely before storing."/><div class="swiper-lazy-preloader swiper-lazy-preloader-white"></div></div><div class="swiper-slide wpz-insta-album-image" data-media-type="image"><img class="wpzoom-swiper-image swiper-lazy" data-src="https://scontent-sin6-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/329242867_135386602755484_4899082798761023599_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&#038;ccb=1-7&#038;_nc_sid=8ae9d6&#038;_nc_ohc=qPRfYCvvVDsAX8tZjwN&#038;_nc_ht=scontent-sin6-2.cdninstagram.com&#038;edm=ANo9K5cEAAAA&#038;oh=00_AfAK5l6QRSffU-hUjVerbDcjyHEp-P5UWkrCYbHDr7f3vQ&#038;oe=63F8D96B" alt="&lt;Recipe&gt; Caramel Pop Corn with Cashew Nuts  Once you realise how easy and cheap to make this at home, you probably will think twice before scrambling to grab that expensive pack or bottle off the shelves now. 😄  Ingredients :

75g pop corn kennels
40g butter, melted
60g cashew nuts, chopped into halves (optional)  Caramel Sauce :
70g sugar
25g dark brown sugar
10g butter
2 tbsp water  Method :
1️⃣ Place corn kennels into a 24-cm deep wok pan, preferably with a transparent cover that comes with a steam outlet. Add in melted butter and mix well to coat with the corn kennels.  2️⃣ Cover the pan with medium heat. The corn kennels will start popping after a while. Once the popping stops completely, off the heat.  3️⃣ Combine all the ingredients for the caramel sauce and cook till the sugar melted. Add in the cashew nuts and continue cooking till the sugar caramelised.  4️⃣ You may adjust the sweetness of the pop corn by adjusting the amount of caramel sauce that is to be mixed with the pop corn. I used approx 4-5 tbsp of caramel sauce for every 60g of pop corn.  5️⃣ Stir the sauce evenly over the pop corn. I did this in small batches so that it’s easier to adjust the sweetness for different people. The caramel sauce will thicken once cooled down so be prepared to reheat the sauce when doing the next batch.  6️⃣ Spread the caramel pop corn onto a wired tray with  a baking tray beneath. Toast it at 180 degrees C for 4-5 mins in the middle rack before removing from heat.

75g pop corn kennels
40g butter, melted
60g cashew nuts, chopped into halves (optional)  Caramel Sauce :
70g sugar
25g dark brown sugar
10g butter
2 tbsp water  Method :
1️⃣ Place corn kennels into a 24-cm deep wok pan, preferably with a transparent cover that comes with a steam outlet. Add in melted butter and mix well to coat with the corn kennels.  2️⃣ Cover the pan with medium heat. The corn kennels will start popping after a while. Once the popping stops completely, off the heat.  3️⃣ Combine all the ingredients for the caramel sauce and cook till the sugar melted. Add in the cashew nuts and continue cooking till the sugar caramelised.  4️⃣ You may adjust the sweetness of the pop corn by adjusting the amount of caramel sauce that is to be mixed with the pop corn. I used approx 4-5 tbsp of caramel sauce for every 60g of pop corn.  5️⃣ Stir the sauce evenly over the pop corn. I did this in small batches so that it’s easier to adjust the sweetness for different people.
