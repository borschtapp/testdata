They were DELICIOUS. Made some substitutions which allowed me to finish a bunch of almost-empty nut butters, so I did mostly tahini, some Trader Joes mixed nut butter, and a bit of peanut butter. I also didn't have coconut sugar so I used raw turbinado sugar since it has a similar consistency. One small mistake I made was that I accidentally used corn starch instead of baking powder (whoops, both cans looked the same!), so they may not have risen as much as they would have, but still tasted incredible. Next time I plan on adding walnuts too :)"},{"@type":"Review","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sophia E"},"datePublished":"2020-04-13","reviewBody":"Made these brownies during quarantine; my boyfriend and I ate them in 2 days (that says it all right?!)

These are likely the best brownies I've EVER made, just to echo basically all of the comments here! As soon as I saw the reviews I knew I needed to make these and I was NOT disappointed! I am vegan, so I subbed the 2 eggs for 2 vegan egg replacer (bob's red mill powder, not flax) and they turned out perfect. I also added a tiny bit less coconut sugar than it calls for. I can't wait to make these again and again, and try different things, like diff nut butters/adding nuts/swirling PB on top... yum! Thank you for this!"},{"@type":"Review","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jacquelyn"},"datePublished":"2021-01-10","reviewBody":"Just made these yesterday and they are amazing.

They seem to be even more delicious a few days after baking!  When they were fresh, the tahini flavor was strong, so my son was not a fan, but a few days later, the tahini flavor is barely there ... just chewy brownie goodness!\r\n\r\nI love your \"real food\" philosophy.  I have a sweet tooth and your dessert recipes make me feel like I can indulge with less guilt. :)  After enjoying your instagram feed for a while now, I decided it was time to order your cookbook!

We are paleo and my child has developed a serious nut allergy. I'm so so glad to have found this recipe since so many paleo treats have almond flour.

<p>THESE BROWNIES ARE LIFE CHANGING!</p>
<p>Apologies for the all caps. But really&hellip;these brownies are about to change your brownie eating lifestyle for the better.</p>
<h2>The most FUDGEY brownies that are flourless, nut-free, paleo and they are SO easy to bake.</h2>
<p>I constantly find myself craving brownies lately. All day, everyday, ya girl just wants a thick brownie that melts in my mouth when it is warmed up. You know when the chocolate is oozing out and it&rsquo;s almost too fudgey to even stay together? Ya, that kind of brownie is what we are baking today.</p>
<p>Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love all my brownie recipes. Especially those <a href="https://rachlmansfield.com/gluten-free-chocolate-chip-cookie-brownies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chocolate chip cookie brownies</a>. Butt these are next level.</p>
<p>Probably because they require basically no ingredients (but really only 6 key ingredients are needed) and because my favorite dark chocolate is involved.</p>
<p>Hu Kitchen Dark Chocolate Gems! Now there is a reason that they call these bad boys gems. They live up to the name too. And let me tell you &ndash; you won&rsquo;t even realize they have no refined sugar in them. They are the healthiest baking and snacking chocolate you could imagine. Sweetened with coconut sugar. Made with all organic ingredients (you know the drill with my Hu fam). Plus the gems melt so perfectly in these brownies, it is basically like eating a lava cake.</p>
<p>Oh and don&rsquo;t forget to sprinkle some on top after the brownies bake!<span id="more-25933"></span></p>
<h2>Key ingredients needed to bake these flourless brownies:</h2>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015WU3X5Q/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rachlmansfi01-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B015WU3X5Q&amp;linkId=746f4a1dfbfd7f266a1d7d2ea7e146b5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Creamy tahini.</a> I use tahini in these brownies to make them nut-free and because it is more of a subtle flavored nut/seed butter. Feel free to use whatever nut butter you desire!</li>
<li>Maple syrup. For a little sweetener here in combination with coconut sugar. Sub honey if you prefer!</li>
<li>Coconut sugar. I love baking with coconut sugar. It adds the best sweetener and best consistency to these brownies. Plus it helps keep them refined sugar-free.</li>
<li>Pasture-raised eggs. I haven&rsquo;t tested flax eggs here. If you do and it works, let me know!</li>
<li>Cacao powder. They key ingredient for all brownies besides the extra dark chocolate of course.</li>
<li><a href="http://bit.ly/2IW2WwE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hu Kitchen Dark Chocolate Gems</a>. My obsession. My forever baking addition. These melt SO perfectly in the brownies!! Code RACHL for free shipping ya&rsquo;ll!</li>

THESE ARE IT. I&rsquo;ve made them a couple of times now, and they are ALWAYS hit. No one can believe they are made with tahini! (Don&rsquo;t let the tahini deter you from making these) Seriously so amazingly fudgy and delicious and the perfect amount of sweetness! Thank you, Rachel!!!</p>

The tahini makes them have a nice nutty flavor, which balances nicely with the sweetness. The texture is unreal. Made these for friends for Valentine&rsquo;s Day, and they all loved them!</p>

They were DELICIOUS. Made some substitutions which allowed me to finish a bunch of almost-empty nut butters, so I did mostly tahini, some Trader Joes mixed nut butter, and a bit of peanut butter. I also didn&rsquo;t have coconut sugar so I used raw turbinado sugar since it has a similar consistency. One small mistake I made was that I accidentally used corn starch instead of baking powder (whoops, both cans looked the same!), so they may not have risen as much as they would have, but still tasted incredible. Next time I plan on adding walnuts too &#128578;</p>

I used brown sugar instead of coconut sugar and it was totally fine.

But I would definitely recommend making these and I will make these again!!!</p>

These are likely the best brownies I&rsquo;ve EVER made, just to echo basically all of the comments here! As soon as I saw the reviews I knew I needed to make these and I was NOT disappointed! I am vegan, so I subbed the 2 eggs for 2 vegan egg replacer (bob&rsquo;s red mill powder, not flax) and they turned out perfect. I also added a tiny bit less coconut sugar than it calls for. I can&rsquo;t wait to make these again and again, and try different things, like diff nut butters/adding nuts/swirling PB on top&hellip; yum! Thank you for this!</p>

<p>I just made these brownies tonight and loved the taste, but they came out very cakey and not fudgy at all. I subbed the tahini for RX vanilla almond butter but followed the recipe exactly as written, although I did use mini chocolate chips versus Hu gems since I do not have the gems. I had to take the brownies out of the oven sooner since they were already quite hard at around 16 minutes, and have continued to firm up after cooling. Have any idea where I went wrong? Thanks for the great recipe, maybe I&rsquo;ll have to add more liquid next time to get the right texture.</p>

<p>These brownies are delicious! I only used 1/4 cup of coconut sugar because that was all I had in and I decided to skip the chocolate chips and replace with chopped walnuts. So easy to make and so delicious!</p>

I have made a number of your sweet and savory recipes, and they are all excellent and come together just as you describe. I totally trust in your recipes, and it is such a relief to have found you as I was really struggling to make quality gf baked goods, which was really frustrating (and expensive). For this recipe, I used 1/2 tahini and 1/2 almond butter, and I baked them in a muffin pan because I don&rsquo;t have an 8&times;8 pan&ndash;they are fudgy and moist and pair perfectly with a glass of (almond) milk! All of the stars!</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I originally tried recipe with tahini, not that crazy about flavor. This time tried peanut butter. Flavor much better. Both times seemed a little dry and I took out earlier this time. Also mine are much darker and not as thick as on photo</p>

The brownies are chocolatey and thick with the right amount of sweetness. I used this recipe recently to make birthday cupcakes. So I added an extra egg to the recipe &amp; excluded the hu gems. Once the cupcakes were cool I melted the hu gems and dipped the top of the cupcakes in it &amp; added a strawberry on top. They looked &amp; tasted amazing. We are paleo and my child has developed a serious nut allergy. I&rsquo;m so so glad to have found this recipe since so many paleo treats have almond flour. One question- any idea how these are after being frozen?</p>
