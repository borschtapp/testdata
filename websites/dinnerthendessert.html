<p>Curries are so different and yet somehow they are all so comforting. If you&#8217;ve never really enjoyed them, try cooking it at home and you may find you absolutely love experimenting with all different versions of curries from Chinese to Japanese to Thai to Indian.</p>



<div class="wp-block-mv-video"><div class="mv-video-target mv-video-id-hiih5pgl2ipywsg4y5zq" data-video-id="hiih5pgl2ipywsg4y5zq" data-ratio="16:9" data-volume="70"></div></div>



<p>The most popular is probably Indian Curry because of the warm flavors, and Indian dishes use the addition of heavy cream instead of the more coconut flavors of Thai curry.</p>



<p>This Chicken Korma recipe is well flavored and balanced, but it is less of a punch of flavor than another favorite Indian recipe, Butter Chicken.</p>

Apart from the time it marinates, the curry can be made in just 45 minutes.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1644361198040"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Is a korma a curry?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Yes, korma is an Indian curry dish made with garam masala.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1644361206301"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What vegetables can you put in a Chicken Korma?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">The classic Chicken Korma recipe includes onions, garlic and ginger but red bell peppers, carrots or potatoes would work well in the dish as well as they&#8217;d complement the lighter flavors of the korma curry.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1644361215613"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Can you substitute coconut milk in Chicken Korma?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Absolutely. If you have a preference for coconut milk to heavy cream you can add it in. I prefer heavy cream personally for its richness and because it doesn&#8217;t compete with the flavors of the spices in the chicken korma.</p> </div> </div>

<p>Love this recipe, I make it all the time. Not only does it taste wonderful, the house smells so good afterwards. I serve with naan and cauliflower rice (my spouse is on a keto kick). Sometimes I pair it with your saag recipe. Always a hit!</p>

<p>Made this based on ratings alone even though I was hoping for an instant pot recipe. Wasn’t able to marinate for the suggested times and was still so delicious!!!! Making for the second time and know it will not disappoint. So easy but captures the warm and rich Indian flavours perfectly.</p>

					<p>Really nice combination of spices and very simple. I marinaded the chicken all day as I was working. Turned out great. </p>
<p>One thing I wanted to ask was how to loosen the suave up as it went very thick when sitting with rice. I read add water but wouldn’t that dilute the flavors?</p>

					<p>It shouldn&#8217;t dilute the flavors too much, just don&#8217;t add a lot of water all at once. Try a tablespoon at a time. Glad you enjoyed it!</p>

<p>Love this recipe, would definitely recommend for a date night. I elected to use cashews rather than almonds and add some more bulky veggies. This was excellent and look forward to trying many other of your recipes</p>

<p>Hi Sabrina,</p>
<p>I searched online for a couple hours looking for a korma recipe and was quite pleased to find yours. This is amazing! I ended up cooking it a day later than anticipated, so chicken marinated for 24 hours. It was very tender and the spice blend and ratio are great. I garnished with chopped cilantro and served with basmati rice and garlic naan. Hubby and I stuffed ourselves until we couldn’t move ?</p>
<p>I will definitely be making this again and will try it with the homemade garam masala which I’m sure will add even more flavor. Planning to try your Tikka Masala next.</p>
<p>Question: for the recipes containing yogurt in the marinade, can the chicken be frozen in the marinade for future use? It sure would be convenient to make bigger batches and freeze in dinner sized portions with very little work needed to complete the meal.</p>

<p>Haven&#8217;t made this recipe yet, but looks good. I&#8217;m trying to find some tweaks to improve my recipe. For those who had issues grinding the almonds try almond flour, it&#8217;s blanched peeled ground almonds. I&#8217;ve even used almond butter before and it&#8217;s worked well too.<br />
The only thing a little different with this recipe is how the ingredients are pureed first in the marinade, most recipes I&#8217;ve seen/used the puree is done after cooking the onions, and usually with the cream or some yogurt to help thin it. I am going do a quick puree for the marinade to really blend it, but will still blend the onion and nuts later. I&#8217;m going to add the tomato to the marinade, I&#8217;ve never used tomato in my korma but am willing to give it a try (I think adding it to the marinade will allow the spices to blend better).<br />
Definitely toast your spices if you can!</p>

<p>Made it for my History project. Tasted great! I do have to say when I was processing my paste I had to add water because the almonds did not want to blend. Thank you!</p>

					<p>I like the flavors of this recipe a lot, but I find that the paste you have to make with the almonds, tomato paste, ginger, garlic and spices is just so difficult and impractical to do in a food processor, unless it’s just because I have a very small and cheap 3 cup counter-top appliance? It just won’t do it. Maybe if you have a very expensive and powerful blender it’s ok, but it’s a very dry mix. I can only do this easily by actually grinding the almonds first in a coffee grinder and even that isn’t very ideal… but it’s workable.</p>
<p>The paste you get is so thick and I always have to add a little water, and a little more… I almost feel like this would be better done by hand with mortar and pestle but that’s too tedious for me to make it an easy meal. I’m an American that’s just begun to appreciate the deep flavors and rich combinations of Indian spices, and I know these are sort of westernized recipes but I like them so far a lot, I just have trouble with the preparation as given and I wonder if you should make some adjustments to your explanation to note that you need a different method or something because a good recipe should be simple to reproduce exactly if all steps are followed. If you can’t do so, then something is wrong.</p>
<p>Great flavor, love the dish, but difficult preparation that I wish would be easier.</p>

<p>Alexander, this review is kind of silly, no offense. But, yes, this is an issue with your cheap appliance. I recommend getting a good food processor if you like cooking. This is how Indian recipes are often made, and complaining about the steps is a strange choice. Just practice more, maybe invest in a better processor or accept that good food takes time 🙂</p>

					<p>I have an insanely expensive blender that can probably play the national anthem if I press the right button, but I still have to use my old trusty food processor for this kind of job. It&#8217;s nothing fancy &#8211; big, flat bottom w/ 2 big horizontal blades. </p>
<p>It sounds to me like the blades on your food processor are either angled upwards, are too short or placed too far from the bottom &#8211; the almonds shouldn&#8217;t have anywhere to &#8220;hide&#8221;</p>
<p>Have you tried adding the yogurt and a few tbsps of water to the mix before blitzing?</p>

					<p>A way you could make this easier would be to use garlic/ginger paste (or powder for less flavor) for your marinade and skip the puree until after you cook onions, take them out before you cook the chicken then just puree almonds, cooked onions, and the cream, then add back to the cooked chicken and finish. You can also find almond flour online or in the grocery store which skips the need for grinding almonds. If you use garlic/ginger paste, almond flour, and cut everything small you can skip the processor altogether, it just wouldn&#8217;t incorporate the flavors as much I imagine but will speed up the prep. </p>
<p>You should be able to do all the pureeing necessary with a magic bullet, I&#8217;ve done it before with just that! Just add some cream or liquid, the hot onions will help temper the cream and it&#8217;s never broken on me.</p>

					<p>I love this recipe and I make it about once a month now. However, I agree about the paste so I always add the greek yoghurt to the blender as well now, plus sometimes a little water. It works really well. I honestly don&#8217;t know how anybody gets a paste without adding something else to the dry mix.</p>

					<p>Hey Sabrina! I would just like to provide a clarification as an Indian who has grown up with authentic mughlai cuisine as part of my household. Qorma is a mughlai dish that has a very specific list of ingredients and spices&#8230; And any slight variation will shift it towards another category of curry. What I learned from my grandmother and my mother is that certain ingredients are not added in qorma at all. These are turmeric, tomatoes, coriander, green chili, tomato paste. What should be added are fried onions that is crushed and made into a paste with almonds and cashews there&#8217;s no cream in it as well. Mace and nutmeg are also essential for the specific aroma and flavor. Another essential ingredient added towards the end is kewra water&#8230; Which is an essence derived from the kewra plant. Qorma should be orange &#8211; ish in color and the garnish should be fried onions and almond slivers.<br />
All the best and hope you enjoy making more Indian dishes! 🙂</p>
