    "¼ cup dried unsweetened cranberries",

    "2 1½-inch-thick bone-in pork rib chops (about 1 pound each), patted dry",
    "Kosher salt",
    "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided",
    "3 sprigs thyme",
    "3 garlic cloves, smashed",
    "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces",
    "1 small shallot, finely chopped",
    "6 large or 8 medium celery stalks, thinly sliced on a diagonal",

      "text": "Season pork generously with salt, then rub with 1 Tbsp. oil total. Heat a dry medium skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium. Cook pork chops, moving once or twice to hotter areas of skillet, until first side is deeply browned, 6–9 minutes. Turn pork chops and cook until second sides are browned, about 5 minutes. Working one at a time, set chops on fatty side with tongs to melt and brown fat cap, about 1 minute each. At this point an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of each chop should register 135°."

Tilt skillet toward you so butter pools in the pan and spoon foaming butter over chops continuously until butter is browned, about 1 minute. Transfer pork chops, thyme, and garlic to a cutting board and let meat rest while you assemble the salad."
