  "description": "A fervent believer in giving folks what they ask for, I recently polled my readers for the next dish they wanted me to make. The winner was chicken and I felt it only fitting to finally put one of my favorite recipes that in my Lighter (blue) book on the blog. In fact, it's called Jeffrey's Favorite Chicken for a reason and seeing how it's tender cutlets in a light, yet rich and hearty lemon-wine sauce loaded with mushrooms, spinach, artichokes and sun-dried tomatoes, can you blame me? It can also easily be keto, paleo, gluten-free and dairy-free (see Jeff's Tips).",
