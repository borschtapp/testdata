Pour over the ahi tuna steaks and turn over to coat completely. Optional: allow to marinate for at least 10 minutes, or up to overnight in the refrigerator. Also optional: Reserve a spoonful or two of the marinade before coating the fish for drizzling on top after you've cooked it.",

Use your best judgement whether you use medium, medium-high, or high heat, as the marinade may burn if too high heat is used)",
