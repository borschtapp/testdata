  "name": "Butternut Squash Mac and Cheese with Broccoli",
  "description": "Spiced butternut squash blended with nutritional yeast and a little plant milk makes a delightfully rich and “cheesy” sauce for pasta and broccoli. Pumpkin, acorn squash, or delicata squash will also work in this recipe. To make this recipe gluten-free, chose a whole grain pasta made with rice, corn, and/or quinoa.",
