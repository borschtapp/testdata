  "description": "[related-posts]One of the great things about spring menus is all the tender, fresh green vegetable dishes. Longstanding Midtown dining spot Michael's New York, owned by restaurateur Michael McCarty, boasts a Dutch recipe we had to try: citrus-steamed Dutch white asparagus (they actually do a mix of white and green) with a wine-spiked butter sauce, a runny poached egg and a little Parmesan cheese. A little prosciutto never hurt anyone, either.",
