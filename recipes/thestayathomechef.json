RECIPE NOTES: *You can easily substitute buttermilk in place of the milk in this recipe to turn it into a buttermilk pancake recipe. If you don't have buttermilk on hand, you can also use buttermilk substitutes: https://thestayathomechef.com/buttermilk-substitute/ To turn this recipe into a dry pancake mix: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Transfer to a resealable plastic bag or sealable storage container for storage. When ready to use mix with 1 cup milk, 2 eggs and 1/4 cup melted butter. Double, triple, or quadruple the recipe and you will need 1 3/4 cup of the pancake mix to combine with the wet ingredients. üç¥üç¥üç¥üç¥üç¥üç¥üç¥üç¥üç¥ Thanks for watching!
