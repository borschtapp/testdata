  "text": "Have you ever tried matcha? Matcha is ground green tea with an intense green color and a slightly tart flavor. I personally prefer jams to be a little less sweet, so I found matcha the perfect ingredient to give it an exciting upgrade without adding sweetness. The flavors of the subtle tea and the sweet fruit go very well together. If you have any matcha powder left over, you can sprinkle a little on top of your jam-slathered toast to enhance the flavor even more.",

      "text": "To test whether the jam will set up once it's cooled, place a small spoonful of the hot jam on the \r\n plate from the freezer and hold the plate at an angle. If the mass becomes solid after a short time and you can swipe your finger through the jam leaving an unconnected gap, the test is passed and the jam is ready; if not, continue cooking and repeating the test. Pour the still hot jam into sterilized preserving jars, seal, and let cool. Enjoy!",
