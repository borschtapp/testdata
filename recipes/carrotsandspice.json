      "text": "In a food processor pulsate the crackers until nice and crumbly, add the melted butter and give a few pulses until mixed thoroughly. Put the crust mix into a springform cake tin (I used 8”) and press firmly to create an even layer. Chill in the fridge while preparing the cheesecake mixture. Beat the cream cheese, with the powdered sugar and vanilla extract in a bowl until it forms a smooth mixture with no lumps. Beat in the jar of Nutella until mixture is combined. Beat in the ½ cup cream until mixture looks shiny and mousse-like. Dollop mixture onto graham crust and smooth the surface. Just before refrigerating the cheesecake add some topping if you wish, I crumbled some Ferro Rocher Chocolates and sprinkled on top for some décor. Chill in the fridge for a 4 hours or, preferably, overnight."
