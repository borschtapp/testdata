Add more salt or lemon juice as needed until it tastes good to you. Divide among bowls and sprinkle with some parsley for serving. Leftovers will keep for about a week refrigerated, or up to 3 months frozen. Links: Chicken Noodle Soup here on Simply Recipes, also great for when you are under the weather!"
