To blanch, boil peppers for 2 minutes and place in an ice bath. In the oven, place cut-side down in a casserole dish with the bottom covered in water and top with foil; bake for 20 minutes at 425F. For the grill, place directly on oiled grates over medium-high heat for 6-7 minutes, flipping halfway through.",
