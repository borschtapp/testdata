    {
      "text": "Heat 2 tablespoons of avocado oil in a 5-quart (5 liter) ceramic pot over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches, add 6-7 pieces of short rib at a time to the pot and sear without disturbing for 2-3 minutes, until a golden brown crust forms. Turn the pieces and continue cooking until seared well on all sides. Remove the short ribs from the pan and set aside, adding another tablespoon of avocado oil to the pot if needed, and repeat with the remaining short ribs."

    {
      "text": "Reduce the heat to medium and add the onion, celery, and the remaining ½ teaspoon of salt. Sauté for 3-4 minutes, until the vegetables begin to soften and release moisture."

    {
      "text": "Add the tomato paste and stir to coat the vegetables, then cook for 2 minutes. Add the flour and stir to coat the vegetables, then cook for 2-3 minutes more, until deep red in color. Pour in the wine and stir to release any browned bits from the bottom of the pot."

      "text": "Nestle the short ribs on top of the vegetables in the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the liquid is reduced by about half, 15-20 minutes."

    {
      "text": "While the short ribs are in the oven, make the cauliflower mash: Fill a medium pot with about an inch of water and set a steamer basket inside. Cover and bring the water to a simmer over medium-high heat. Add the cauliflower to the basket and steam for 12-15 minutes, until mashable with the back of a fork, but not overcooked."

      "text": "Working in batches, transfer the steamed cauliflower to a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl. Using another bowl that is slightly smaller than the strainer, press the bowl into the cauliflower to press excess liquid from the cauliflower. Repeat with remaining cauliflower. Discard the liquid and set the cauliflower aside."

    {
      "text": "Add the cashews to the bowl of a food processor. Blend on high speed for 2-3 minutes, until the cashews are completely broken down and can be mashed into a paste between your fingers, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary."
