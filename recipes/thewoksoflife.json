  "description": "“Fluffy” and “chewy” are how I like to describe these Whole Wheat Mantou. These are almost always the two words that come to mind when I come across really, really good mantou (Chinese steamed buns). I had my fair share of whole wheat mantou when we lived in Beijing, as they are surprisingly common",

    "1 ⅔ cups warm milk ((400 ml))",

    "1 tablespoon sugar ((12 grams))",
    "2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour ((400 grams))",

      "text": "Heat the milk until warm to the touch (not hot). Then stir in the yeast and sugar until it dissolves. Combine the milk mixture with 2 ¾ cups of all-purpose flour in a large mixing bowl. The mixture will be wet. Cover with a damp cloth and let proof in a warm spot for 1-2 hours until the mixture doubles in size. Since it’s winter, I let the dough proof near a heat vent!",

Space the mantou out on a steaming rack about 1-inch apart. You will need 2-3 racks, or you can steam them in a few separate batches.",

Steam for 15 minutes using high heat, then turn off the heat, and wait 5 minutes before opening the lid to check your mantou. The last step will ensure your mantou come out full and smooth! Otherwise, they will collapse and look lumpy.",
